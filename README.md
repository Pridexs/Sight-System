This is a Sight/Light System made using the ideas presented by nutcasenightmare (http://ncase.me/) and adapted to C++ and SFML.

At the moment, it's roughly just a raw adaptation, I slowly made this reviewing all the math used and taking all the steps, but I'll be expanding this as I adapt this system into the game that I'm currently making.

There is a lot of optimization needed still but I will be updating this page as I make changes.

You can check a demo of this here http://youtu.be/t-0BVkOtJqs and learn more stuff at http://pridexs.com/blog.
